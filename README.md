# Introduction
Hello, my name is Evan Cannon, also known as iiSupaCannon. I am a security engineer at Eurecom since September 2019. Previously, I was a student at Institut Eur√©com, Sophia Antipolis. 

This github page contains all my work over the past few years. I'm a big supporter of privacy and am studying topics on OSINT off late. Feel free to contribute to my projects.
